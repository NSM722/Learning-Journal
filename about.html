      <p><strong>How I stay committed to learning</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create
        simple
        projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
      </p>
      <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my
        journey
        with the world.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How I got started</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning.
        After
        each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of
        what
        I learned using my own words.
      </p>

      <p>That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping
        others
        learn and stay motivated.
